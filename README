Thank you for taking your time to look at this project. These 
are the source-code files from my first programming course in 
Computer Sciences at Univeristy of Lund, and are mainly used by 
me as a reference.

git clone https://github.com/tfla/cs_eda016
mkdir bin
javac -d /bin/ ./cs_eda016/cs_eda016/src/se/lth/cs/ptdc/*/*.java
jar -cf cs_eda016.jar ./bin/se/lth/cs/ptdc/*/*.class
javac -classpath ./cs_eda016.jar -d ./bin/ ./inl2/*.java

(Yeah, they don't really work at the moment, going to solve that 
soon rather than later.)

Substitude inl2 with whatever folder it is you are interested in 
building. Some folders (inl1, lab05 and lab06) requires 
Turtle.java (from lab04) in the build path too.

1. Known issues
Some programs aren't 100% complete.
